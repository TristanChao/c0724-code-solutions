## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  - a function is a callable section of code that is good for reusability
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  - optional name, parameters, code block, optional return
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  - optional name, arguments
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  - function definition specifies the actions a function will take when it is called
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  - a parameter created during definition as a placeholder for arguments when being called
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  - parameters allow you to change the values that are manipulated in a function, letting you use the same function for multiple different purposes
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  - the return statement ends the execution of a function and allows a value to be sent out of the function
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  - variable keyword, name, `=` operator, parameters in `()` separated by commas, `=>` operator, code block
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  - the body becomes an implicit return, only allowing one expression and returning the result of the expression from the function
