## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  - a loop allows you to repeat sections of code without having to type them out again
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  - the condition expression will exit out of the loop when met, and prevents infinite loops
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  - one iteration is when all the code in the loop code block is executed once
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  - at the start, before the code is run
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  - upon entering the loop
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  - before each iteration
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  - at the end of each iteration, after the body is run
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  - `break;`
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  - adds one to the value of a variable, then returns that value back to the variable
  - it's the same as `variable = variable + 1` or `variable += 1`
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  - `for (const key in object)`
