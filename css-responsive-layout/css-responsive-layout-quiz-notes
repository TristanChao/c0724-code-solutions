## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  - a breakpoint is a width at which the web page changes layout
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  - using percentages will allow the elements to scale with the page, while fixed widths will remain the same size as the page changes size
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  - the source order of the css cascade will apply the style of the smaller min-width after the larger one, and since the smaller one will always apply with the larger one, it will always override the larger one
